&amp;nbsp;Any damage that reduces the function of the kidney is called renal disease also called as Kidney disease. There are two types of Kidney Disease:- Acute and chronic. Acute kidney disease is a sudden temporary loss of kidney functioning. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs when the kidney can no longer perform their function i.e. clean toxins and waste products from the blood. It happens over time.
To study CKD, we must know that how we measure the functioning of the kidney. The accepted measure of kidney function is the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). It measures the level of creatinine in blood or serum creatinine. Basically, if kidney function declines then creatinine level increases.  There are 5 stages of CKD:-
1.	Stage 1- when GFR is equal to or increased by 90%. It is difficult for a person to identify that they are suffering from this Stage 1 because there are usually no symptoms of this as because our kidney do a good job even they are not functioning at 100%.
2.	Stage 2- when GFR is between 60-89%. It is very similar to Stage 2 and this stage also does not have any symptoms. There is a mild increase in the level of creatinine at this stage.
3.	Stage 3- when GFR is 30-59%. This is the serious stage of kidney disease. Symptoms are fatigue, swelling, anemia, sleep disorder, concentration trouble, etc.
4.	Stage 4- when GFR is 15-29%. At this stage, a person needs dialysis or is near to transplant. There are many symptoms of this stage like swelling, fatigue, anemia, nausea, vomiting, kidney pain in back, urination changes. The complication of a person increases as the waste product in blood is not filtered properly and gets collected in the blood causing a condition called uremia.
5.	Stage 5- when GFR is less than 15%. When kidney attends this stage, it is totally damaged and the patient is suffering from Kidney Failure. At this advanced stage of kidney disease, the kidneys have lost nearly all their ability to do their job effectively, and eventually, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to live. Because the kidneys are no longer able to remove waste and fluids from the body, toxins build up in the blood, causing an overall ill feeling.&amp;nbsp;
One can diagnose by the above symptoms that they are suffering from CKD or not. If they are suffering from any stage of CKD, they immediately need to take more care of their kidney and consult a good doctor for your treatment or medicine.

                            <p class="mt-5 max-lines">&amp;nbsp;Yoga increases health and stamina, reduces stress, and improves those conditions brought by a luxury lifestyle. It also improves psychological health during other severe diseases, it acts as a complementary interaction for patients also for reducing depression, insomnia, pain, fatigue and to decrease anxiety and increase anxiety control. &amp;nbsp;
Yoga has positive effects on mental health. Yoga can be excellent training for both adolescents and children. It increases physical exercise, breathing, focus, mindfulness, and stress relief. In fact, in many districts, schools have considered yoga into their Physical Education programs.  Yoga not only enhances our physical strength but also contributes largely towards your mental health and spiritual growth. Yoga not only keeps us fit but also has long term benefits when making it an integral part of your lifestyle. 
Some benefits are mentioned below-

Yoga helps us to be more mindful- in simple words being mindful means paying a little more attention to each action you do, allowing us to be more present, aware, and alive in each moment.
Yoga reduces anxiety- poor posture, tensed muscles, and shallow breathing are causes of anxiety. The mind and body are so interlinked, that physically deepening the breath, improving posture, and relaxing the muscles can help reduce anxiety.
Yoga helps us to breathe better- breath is something we have every moment, posture may not be lifetime but breath will be. The breath should be taken properly.
Yoga drops the blood pressure- if you have got high blood pressure, you surely will get benefit from yoga.
Yoga decreases blood sugar- yoga lowers blood sugar and bad (LDL) cholesterol and boosts good (HDL) cholesterol. Yoga lowers blood sugar level by lowering cortisol and decreases the risk of diabetic complications like heart attack, kidney failure, or blindness.
Yoga increases the ability to focus- regular yoga practice improves coordination, reaction time memory, and even IQ scores. The important concept of yoga is focusing on the present.
Yoga improves our flexibility- being flexible can help you prevent injuries, back pain, and balance problems. A well-stretched muscle more easily achieves its full range of motion.
Yoga builds muscle strength- Strong muscles protect us from conditions like arthritis and back pain. When we build strength through yoga, we balance it with flexibility.
Yoga helps to develop better posture- poor posture can cause back, neck, and other muscle and joint problems.
Betters our bone health- yoga can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and help keep calcium in bones.
Yoga increases our blood flow- the relaxation exercise we learn in yoga can help our circulation, especially in hands and feet. Yoga helps more oxygen to our cells, which results in better functioning of blood cells.
